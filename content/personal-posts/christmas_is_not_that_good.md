# Christmas

First of all, merry Christmas! It's nice to see that your year went well. Now I hope you can go through 2026 well too.
Christmas is such a good time to care about people you like.

## Marketing

Well, I live in Brazil. I was born basically in the middle of nowhere, in a state that almost no one really cares about.
But somehow, companies try to import the classic Christmas things.

I mean, Santa Claus, snow… a bunch of deer? Why deer?
I have never seen snow or deer in my entire life.

This is marketing. Everyone knows that, except younger people.
And it's a stupid kind of marketing that apparently works so well that they do it every year.

## Improving the city instead of spending money on decorations

Instead of improving the city, not burning dry grass, or collecting trash from the streets, the mayor spends a lot of money making stupid animatronics just because they're "cute".
But he never cleans the roads, or fixes the holes in them.

It's not a problem to import silly things.
If you think that's a problem, you would probably hate most music, games, and even languages from many countries — including your own.

## Some thoughts about Christmas

I don't remember exactly what I'm going to say, and I haven't researched this.
I also won't add references. If you search about it, try to use trustworthy sources.
This is just what I learned from my mother...

Christmas was supposedly a pagan ritual set in December, 25 where someone's heart was cut out as an offering to a god, and that heart was placed on top of a tree.
Somehow, Christians later tried to use that date by saying "Jesus Christ was born on that day".

Over time, people made it "softer".
No more Krampus, no more Santa Claus delivering coal to bad kids,
only that smiling Santa Claus that was apparently created by Coca-Cola.

Is it true? I don't know. My mother says that's why she doesn't like it.

## Final thoughts

Thinking about what I said, I don't dislike Christmas itself.
I dislike the amount of bad marketing around it nowadays. AI ads

It's a good holiday to spend with family and friends.
The rest, in my opinion, isn't very good.

I hope your next year goes well. Jehovah bless you!
