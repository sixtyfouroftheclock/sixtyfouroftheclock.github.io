# Hello, again.

In the dawn of the last Saturday of November 2025, my grandmother passed away. I can't explain it in words.
Got the news through my sister, she was whining when called me. Before I open that door,
I had thought "this must be something bad", but not this bad.
I didn't believe it, she was OK in the start of year, after her birthday in September... she got sick.
I'm bad, I'm not OK, I can't express it enough, I must be tough.

My sister is really sad about this, I know she's fighting agaisnt it. I tried
to smile at her, saying "we should smile", "forget about it". Even I can't do that.

Worst thing is my family don't seem to care about our situation.
They say we need psychologists, but, why exactly? Healthcare, mindcare, learning... this starts at home, not by third party.
Sister had hugged me, that was a strange feeling. I've never got that real comfort from anyone since I was a little kid.
Always had expressed me bad, whining, feeling down, closing myself. Parents ask why I don't open myself to her.
Because I'm afraid she would critice me, as once they did this to me.

Doing this is weird.
I yell at people.
I make people worse.
I make people bad.
I know I am wrong moments later.
I don't wanna repeat myself or/and my parents. Yelling won't help you in anything.
I am a failure.
And I need to be better to understand it.
