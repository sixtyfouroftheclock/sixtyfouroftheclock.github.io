One of the most hard parts is giving to things a name. Seriously, it's dumb affirmation, but I got my reasons. Somehow, I can't stick with a name for a long time without finding it idiot. Because look at these names:

- oddyst
- PrescriptionCodes
- UntitledDesk
- RecurringDesk (current)

The previous names of my ""serious"" github page/organization. 3 changes since of oddyst, if I recall. I'm making this post to think about this... Are they really bad or is it just my imagination thinking they're that bad?

oddyst started as a joke that worked at the first moment. It was cool, blah blah blah. But I thought "...mmm this name kinda sucks, actually". And that repeated until now. I'm gonna stick with RecurringDesk until my death. I promise I won't change it.

When I start thinking "I'm gonna change the name of this", I came back here, and read this -> "You suck, because you can't even keep that name for 3 years straight. If you can't do this, how will you maintain some code for a long time?".

This is a message for myself in the future. You suck, future 64.
