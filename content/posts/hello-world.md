First post! Hello, world in C!

```c
// Including the header file INPUT/OUTPUT
#include <stdio.h>

// Creating the main function
int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n"); // Calling a function from `stdio.h`
    return 0; // Saying to the computer that the program exited successfully
}
```

Yeah, I know. For a first post this isnâ€™t a super creative one. Kinda generic and boring.
