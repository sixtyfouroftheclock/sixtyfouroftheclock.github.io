Yeah. I'm writing this at July 20th ---

My fucking god, I'm gonna be 18 in about 11 days! This is so awesome but scarier at the same time (at least for me)! As an example of my oldness, now I can drink so much vodka to reach the beyond and get arrest! But, for real, I'm gonna miss the good old days playing PS2, DBZ B.T.3, RE4...

Thanks for everyone that supported me on all this long way!
