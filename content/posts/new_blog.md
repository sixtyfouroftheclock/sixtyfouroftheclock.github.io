Hey! What's up?

This is the second post I send here. That's not incredible, I know.

Well, now I'll make a new post each week. It's gonna be hard. Earlier I was writing about starting on C and C++, and I'm still writing it!

Sorry, but I used AI for making HTML/CSS. Yup, I'm ashamed. And I don't know anything about them and I don't want to learn it for now. When I learn it I'll make it better! I promise!!

Back then, in mid 2024, I decided to create a blog to put my knowledge inside. The platform chosen was blogger. Yeah, I know, blogger is terrible. It doesn't even provide a markdown file format!

Anyways. I've decided recently that I'll continue with this blog. Wiped all drafts on this blog and make a new UI. But something was annoying me... the automation. Blogger is a shit to type code blocks. You need to use HTML to type it, it's really horrible.

So I decided to move into GitHub, using jekyll as framework. This decision was good, I think. At least now I know how GitHub Actions works!

Well, that's all. I need to think how I will write that article about C/C++. See you!

Note: There are another programs like [bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/). I don't know nothing about webapps, and it's too new for me! So maybe I try new frameworks to make this website!

Ok, I won't promise nothing but probably this is the last time I remake this site. Didn't use ChatGPT. Just using HUGO's docs and Google.
