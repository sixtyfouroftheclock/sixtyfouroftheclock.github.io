# Random stuff

No one really cares what I say. 'Cares' in the "I'm gonna hear you, and say something positive" way. Never use 'care' again. Hate this word.

Yesterday and today were definitely 2 of the worst days I have ever lived. Random people in the town, family, people in internet, and relationship strangely let me down. For now everything seems so gray, so meaningless. Need find a new learning.

Got headaches when I heard "you don't work, you have someone to pay your bills, so why are you so stressed?" - right.

- People get stress while working in warehouses.
- People get stress when lose projects.
- People get stress because they're fighting in a meaningless war.
- People get stress when them get diarrhea because they don't have access to piped water
- People get stress when they're starving.
- People get stress when it can't buy a fucking old bread.

My stress is "I'm burnt out", "I'm whinning, cuz someone swore at me", "They pushed beans onto my plate", "People don't care about me", "My relationships suck so hard". I'm fucking an idiot.

Truth is my pain is meaningless, and I'm weak. Friends know this and don't wanna tell me. Why do I continue sharing my feelings? Can't I hold them in me?

People I had known said you shouldn't self-analyse alone - but I always thought I'm the worst in everything. Everything. Everything. Everything. I mean, literally the worst in everything.

I think this led me to try to be an 'expert' in almost everything, or it was the inverse, I don't fucking know. Fixing the others and feeling relevant were tricking my mind to feel good somehow.

I was talking to a random person on Discord, I said to them "I need someone to teach me X thing", he used a skull emoji because you don't need someone to learn it, and after that I said "I don't need someone to learn that". Fucking contradictory. Felt so dumb, started to recursively type on the phone. Did what I said to them really hurt anyone? No. Did what I said to them make them thought "this guy's crazy"? Probably. Does what I'm doing right now really matter? No. Not for now.

Someone in the world someday will find this, laugh what I'm writing, and think "this is cringe af". A friend said "don't hide your feelings" - feelings. People say 'nobody cares' so easy.

Writing this piece of shit, feeling shit, bad vibes, instead of put myself to sleep. Way out of here. Losing control. Sorry. Shouldn't push it too hard. Need really rest. Need stop overthinking.
