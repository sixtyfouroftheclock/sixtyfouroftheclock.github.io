Before talking about FreeBSD itself, I'll split this article in 2 parts. The first part installing in a VM, and the second part will be installing on my PC.

Now, let's talk why I did want to learn it.

FreeBSD is an operational system that I never wanted to use it. But recently I've been wanting to test it, because I'm wanting learning something new.

When I was searching about `systemd` from Linux and "why it's bad", I had seen a recommendation of OSes (that don't have it) saying more or less this:

> If you don't like systemd, just use _**FreeBSD**_.

Well, if `systemd` is really bloated, I really don't know. To be honest, I don't even remember if it sounded exactly like that. But from that I decided today to install it on a virtual machine.

I downloaded it from an official mirror. The good thing is FreeBSD pretty compatible with any architecture! PowerPC, Arm, x86, Risc-V are precompiled here to download.

## Downloading and installing the system

Before installing, you must remember that in this part will use a VM.

### Downloading the system

Until now, I know that there are 5 file versions of FreeSSD.

- `bootonly.iso`
- `disc1.iso`
- `dvd1.iso`
- `memstick.img`
- `mini-memstick.img`

[![Index of FreeBSD 14.3 releases](/assets/freebsd-14-3-releases.png)](https://download.freebsd.org/releases/amd64/amd64/ISO-IMAGES/14.3/)

The first one I tried was `memstick.img`. I was just curious how I could install it, because it's `.img`, not `.iso`. But I couldn't even boot it using VM. So I tried `disc1.iso` because it has 1.2 gigabyes, and `dvd1.iso` is 4~ gigabytes.

An addendum: the download was too slooooow... So I decided to download it using a brazilian mirror.

### Booting FreeBSD in a VM

So, booting the system, the first thing that shows up is this. The `bootloader`. It's obvious, I guess.

There are options that I don't know what they do! XD

But it's quiet simple and loads very fast - until I press any arrow key down and it enters into a CLI. Meh, it's just strange pressing ↓ and you go to a kind of terminal. Typing `boot` makes FreeBSD boot.

Well, I chose the first one to boot in.

### Installing FreeBSD

And there it is! The FreeBSD Installer! I say I won't explain each step, because this article is not a tutorial.

[![FreeBSD Installer - Welcome](https://docs.freebsd.org/images/books/handbook/bsdinstall/bsdinstall-choose-mode.png)](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/bsdinstall/#bsdinstall-view-probe)

First thing I noticed is the installer looks very similar to Debian.

While partition it, the installer let me choose between `ufs2` and `zfs` to use as my `/`. In the VM I chose `zfs` at the first moment, until I press ↓ and mess everything up. I don't remember how exactly it got messed, but I remember the partition got canceled. But the next try was perfect! It installed perfectly!

#### Installing FreeBSD on my SSD

I'm gonna say, when I was installing FreeBSD on my SSD, I was afraid to delete where my Arch is installed. But don't selecting where it is installed that it doesn't get delete.

## Using the system 

After installing and booting into it, and log in to as root I used `pkg install xfce xfce4-goodies lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter` to install my GUI. It seems that `xfce` is the most desktop environment used on FreeBSD.

Actually I've installed each packages, LOL!

### Activating services

Well, after setting a new user and adding it into the wheel group... I tried to activate the `lightdm.service`. The problem is: how do I do this without systemd???

So, following the official docs... You need to do this:

1. Mount a such of `proc` in `/proc`. What is this? I don't fucking know. It comes already mounted on Linux.
2. Enable `dbus` and `lightdm` in /etc/rc.conf using `sysrc {SERVICE}_enable="YES"`. Note that it's without `{ }`!

So, there is another method that is using `service`, but I don't know how to use it. I think it is `service [app] [option]` - `service lightdm enable`.

I did this, reboot, and black screen. Wtf is happening?

So, I noticed that the packages `xfce xfce4-goodies lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter` don't included the `xorg` package. So, it's done. Now how my VM looks like:

## To be continued on the next articles

Well, that's all for now. Perhaps I've forgot to say something - if so, I'll put on the next article. And thanks for reading this!
